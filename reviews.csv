"Inside Out 2 is ultimately successful, in large part because, like in the first film, the embrace of a harmony and balance among the emotions is emphasized above all else."
"Inside Out 2 is chock full of charm and intelligence, with witty new wordplay that makes our heroes float down a Stream of Consciousness before they face a sarcasm Chasm. "
Pixar again manages to bring heart and humor in a creative and unique way you don’t see coming. 
"Inside Out 2 comes close enough to success that it is going to make billions worldwide, but does not quite cross over into “we will be thinking about this film six months from now”."
"While the first film was undeniably charming, Inside Out 2 takes the concept to new heights. It’s a perfect example of how a sequel can not only meet expectations but far exceed them. "
"It’s a reminder to everyone watching, no matter their age, to seek out community when problems arise, to strengthen bonds of support rather than shun them."
"Inside Out 2 is full of emotional stakes and consequently plays into the character traits of its human figure. Despite being hefty in minutiae, the film can be quite overwhelming in the thesis argument it seeks to convey."
"This sequel manages to address much more complex emotions that appear over time and visualize problems that many children and not so young people are going through today, from a more comical and playful perspective. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Inside Out 2 is a hell of a return to form for Pixar, building upon the foundations of its previous installment with insightful and creative world-building, richly developed characters, and no shortage of wonder and self-reflection."
"One of the reasons the “Toy Story” sequels were so effective was their sense of continuity, which simply doesn’t register here. On the other hand, a few of the new additions beyond Anxiety are inspired."
"It was well made, it was well thought out as an expansion, continuation, and growth of what the previous one was. I just personally will never watch it again, because I can't handle cringe."
"Inside Out 2 is the best PIXAR sequel ever. It deftly taps into the universal experience of young adults with new emotions, coming of age experiences and moral quandaries to navigate while also being a moving commentary on the importance of mental health."
"A fine sequel during which Riley copes with some new emotions, including Anxiety."
"It's a fascinating shift of focus as a result. Where Riley needed her emotions to lead in Inside Out, her salvation in Inside Out 2 lies in stopping them from driving the car into a wall."
"Even with its flaws, it’s still one of the year’s most gorgeous and heartfelt films."
Feels like a natural progression of the story established in the original movie. 
"[Inside Out 2] is a natural progression in terms of Riley’s narrative, exploring the onset of transition from childhood to adulthood. "
"A sequel that, from the start, promises new emotions and adventures inside the human mind, but unfortunately fails to capture the spark and depth of the original. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The turbulent tale of teenage emotions is moving, lovable and wildly creative."
"Inside Out 2 is too nuanced and deeply felt to be called impersonal. It takes Riley's ambivalence and crushing self-esteem issues seriously, while still mining laughs from the awkwardness she finds herself unable to shake off. "
"One of the most perfect of all Pixar flicks has finally been followed by a sequel that, while enjoyable, doesn’t come close to matching the giddy heights of its 2015 predecessor."
A lot better than the original - this is important film that both parents and children need to watch together.
"With smart writing and a talented cast, Inside Out 2 captivates audiences, delivering a successful and heartfelt sequel."
"... more than 1, 2 contains an important message that transcends the target viewing audience, the Riley-aged viewers, expanding its influence to those who’ve yet to learn that anxiety itself isn’t bad, but just another facet of ourselves to understand."
"Scenes flow with seeming simplicity, but Inside Out 2 adds depth to its clarity, using concepts involving complicated issues that affect people on a daily basis"
"With a creaky story, a total absence of logic, and the most squeaky-clean depiction of puberty you could imagine, Inside Out 2 feels less like a $200 million film and more like a cash-grab made-for-TV movie."
"And much like the first movie, Inside Out 2 is wildly funny, tender and sweet, and a little bit tearjerky."
"While Inside Out 2 might lack the emotional gut punch of some of Pixar's previous entries, it's short, sweet and competently crafted. While it might not be Pixar's best, it's also not their worst, and that's a much needed win for the studio. "
Mostly painless and often funny.
"Once again, Pixar has nailed the very core of Inside Out perfectly showcasing the messiness and ugliness of being a teenager. "
"Inside Out 2 is a strong follow-up to Pixar’s modern classic that isn’t quite on the same emotional level as its predecessor, but has enough profundity within its themes and evolution of the core concept that give it plenty of worthiness."
"The outline of these issues seems sensational to me, but not the way they are presented. [Full review in Spanish]"
"While this film has many strengths, the performances from its voice cast are what truly make it special."
"A fantastic sequel which delivers the experience you want from an Inside Out film, but also finds new ways to explore emotions and puberty."
"While the original remains the gold standard for modern animation, this sequel more than justifies its existence via its empathetic themes, strong humour, and engrossing animation style."
"Inside Out 2 is an enjoyable, funny, and sometimes emotionally impactful film. But it fails to stand among Pixar’s best films because it’s too derivative of those films; and many others."
"After a period of some ups and more downs, Pixar can at least boast of following up one of their later classics respectfully. Deserves the healthy audiences it will surely stir up."
" I’ve seen Inside Out 2 twice now, and although it didn’t sweep me off my feet the way that Inside Out did, it didn’t let me go."
"I wanted to laugh more, feel more... It only got about 30 or 40 percent there. "
"I found it a worthy sequel. Just about as clever, moving, and enjoyable as the original film."
The story is unexpectedly compelling and points to the progress being made in society in showing the diverse interests and emotions of individuals.
"Inside Out 2 shows that Disney hasn't completely fallen off. Even though sequels and remakes seem to be the focus, I'm glad this property has been treated with respect and care. What a delight to watch with my kids."
"Just like the first film, the subject matter will cause you to get very self-reflective, causing you to constantly find relatable memories and emotions to go along with what is on screen. "
"This film might not have the groundbreaking impact of its predecessor, but it retains much of the original's imaginative brilliance. "
"Sparky, kaleidoscopic and boldly honest about the tougher side of growing up, Inside Out 2 is Pixar’s most profound and moving movie since, well, Inside Out."
"The beauty of ""Inside Out 2"" is that, different from all other Pixar sequels, it forces its creators to look inward to tell a story of character emotions that manages to resonate with every single audience member. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The backdrop of a young girl's mind provides endless avenues for invention, creating a film rich in colour, texture and a steady stream of sight gags."
"What's extraordinary about this animated coming-of-age feature is how it turns ideas into images, visually demonstrating to children - and their parents - how the subconscious mind works - peppered with suspense and humor."
"Inside Out 2 reminds you of how great Pixar movies can be, and how satisfying a well-executed sequel can feel. "
"The animation, as to be expected, is brilliantly rendered and the story smart and captivating.  While it doesn’t pack the emotional wallop of “IF,” it’s still a great film to take the fmily to."
"Inside Out 2 has me thinking about how the older you get, the more complex emotions are and how we find a way to define ourselves within that glorious mess. And me thinking about it long after the film is done, is [...] a success for the movie..."
Pixar returns to form by revisiting one of its greatest hits.
"Inside Out 2 is grander in scope and complexity than the Oscar-winning original, allowing it to be stacked against Pixar’s greatest sequels!"
"The emotions might be new, but the story is the same old. The lesson has some tread on it, too, but it’s still valuable. "
"Inside Out 2 doesn’t feel necessary, but it does manage to create a fun story while dealing with new aspects of Riley’s character, all accompanied by Pixar’s usual high animation quality."
"Inside Out 2 can't, understandably, match the impact its predecessor originally made, but it does make freshly inventive use of the earlier film's clever conceits."
"The line from Joy about feeling less joy as you get older (and more anxious) is a poignant one, however, Riley calling for Joy in those final scenes…to simply play hockey with her friends slayed me."
"Like its predecessor, Inside Out 2 provides some emotional tools inside an entertaining and relatable package. "
A little chaotic for kids but the Pixar magic still works.
"This new film might be less easily enjoyable, but it feels larger and stirringly sincere in what it attempts to do. In some ways, I found myself more moved this time around, than with its predecessor."
"This is a “coming of age” movie that is not built around trauma, but around the kinds of emotional setbacks encountered in everyday life. It is a movie with a surprisingly adult point of view, and it promotes the positive qualities of adulthood."
"It is an entertaining, emotional sequel full of valuable messages, that makes excellent use of its central concept to deliver a somewhat predictable narrative, which should nevertheless appeal to all family members. Full review in Spanish."
"Inside Out 2 expands the worlds of its characters to capture how our worlds get bigger with age. That, ideally, is what sequels can be for Pixar: a way to help guide young audiences through the turbulence of growing up."
"[Anxiety] has its uses and, when channeled properly, can be a motivating factor, but it can't be the sole thing dictating your personhood. It's, therefore, ironic that Pixar's approach to Inside Out 2 should be so antithetical to the thesis of their film."
"Anyway, I doubt either Inside Out or Inside Out 2 will suffer any real cosmological analysis since it’s a soap opera…cynically? Yes, cynically centered on a child’s early development. "
The animated comedy-drama Inside Out 2 is proof that it’s possible to do something right twice.
A decidedly charming tale that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike and will no doubt spark interesting conversations among viewers who have been through similar situations. [Full review in Spanish]
Inside Out 2 is a safe play for Pixar but continues building out the intricacies of Riley’s mind with an accurate conceptualization of anxiety.
"What “Inside Out 2” does is tee up a theme park attraction. There’s a visit to Imagination Land and, guess what? Epcot has needed a refresh on its imagination ride for years. Score."
"Yes, it lacks anything akin to the first movie’s “Bing-Bong moment”, but the tension is palpable and your emotions definitely feel invested, as Anxiety threatens to destroy all the Joy in Riley’s life."
"Pixar's real triumph is making something that anyone who was ever a teenager can probably relate to. Inside Out 2 sees you, knows you and is you."
Inside Out 2 just saved Hollywood's summer profit margins. Too bad it's just another bland depiction of the Pixar Child's inner life.
I wish I had Inside Out when I was young. 
"Inside Out was groundbreaking and storytelling at its most powerful and entertaining and while this new story didn't pack as much of a punch to the heart as its predecessor, being back in this world was pure joy."
"There’s something very ingenious about an animated film that explores the feelings we have in a way that is tangible, profound and educational."
"Inside Out 2 may not be quite the tearjerker its predecessor was; however, it more than delivers in its humour and heart through its writing and visual gags."
"While not as revelatory as Inside Out, this sequel is a winsome blend of energetic voice work and positive messaging."
"With such a fantastic premise at the soul of the story, it's an unfortunate truth that Pixar dropped the ball on exploring such a prominent time in every person's life with recycled tropes."
"... A gigantic step backward, a soulless film narrated from a psychology book that cannot shake off the obligatory sequel's status [Full review in Spanish]. "
"…short, bright, bubby and thought-provoking for all ages…"
"[capsule review] ""Inside Out 2"" illustrates complex emotions well. Embrace all your emotions; observe them, but also learn to let go. Have passion in what you do, regardless of the outcome. It's part of the joy of living!
"
"For as strong as it is from its first few minutes, Inside Out 2 truly does save the best for last, with everything coming to a highly and believably emotional climax at the camp-concluding scrimmage."
"In many ways, Kelsey Mann’s Inside Out 2 was significantly more emotionally resonant, profound, and insightful than its predecessor. I was pleasantly surprised by how deeply it moved me."
"There’s nothing to rival Bing Bong, but the panic attack scene is a standout moment, a reminder of what the writers and artists of Pixar can do at their best. "
The expansion of the world brings new depth to the franchise and raises the emotional stakes quite well. The results are perhaps Pixar’s best film since Inside Out and the best sequel by the studio since Toy Story 3.
"Inside Out 2 is not a masterpiece, and putting it toe-to-toe against its predecessor would be an ill-matched fight. But it’s an entertaining movie that gets the basics right and pays sufficient homage to the spirit of the original."
"... Monotonous, without the capacity to surprise, relying on a certainty: that the infallible calculator has already predicted the number of viewers. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Inside Out 2 is not only a worthy sequel to its predecessor, but a fantastic animated feature that will leave you and your emotions satisfied."
I particularly enjoyed the specter of anxiety turning into a whirlwind that just burns everything up...
"""Inside Out"" works on so many levels you should not be  shocked if your own emotions of Joy and Envy kick in while watching this production. The film moves at such a rapid rate there is no room for a moment of Ennui."
"There’s plenty of invention at the granular level: the battle within the Projection Room is smart, the sar-chasm is funny, the stream of consciousness is cute. But the story is very much the same."
"Even with Hawke missing some of the comic potential in this role, Anxiety is probably the best thing about this sequel, partly because she is never a pure villain. "
"Inside Out 2 is not without its glorious moments and, without a doubt, the film runs across the screen with the visual exuberance between abstraction and house brand glory. [Full review in Spanish]"
"“Inside Out 2″ is serviceable entertainment. That’s a sad thing to say about a Pixar film, especially when you consider they made classics like “Toy Story,” “The Incredibles,” and, well, the first “Inside Out.”"
"Even if it never quite seems to go far enough, the script touches on several terrific themes, cleverly playing with the way feelings become jumbled as the hormones kick in."
"A beautiful and thought-provoking sequel about the highs and lows of becoming a teenager. Loved the addition of Maya Hawke as ""Anxiety""! "
"As deep as Inside Out 2 is, this is also a thoroughly funny film. Don't think you're paying just to sit through an animated therapy session (though, that actually sounds great)."
"""Inside Out 2"" not only maintains its predecessor's core inner balance theme it also delves into the realm of teen anxiety with a unique twist of 'imperfection '-- great for all ages especially parents, as they will be enlightened to their teens emotions."
Inside Out 2 fulfills the promise of getting to the root of who we are.
"While it is impossible to recreate how Inside Out made us feel upon that first viewing, Inside Out 2 brings a host of new emotions to the table with a clever, succinct story that is, like its predecessor, a delightful surprise."
…hits the same kind of authentic emotional beats that made its predecessor such an instant classic.
"Inside Out completely recontextualized Sadness in the most beautiful way, and now Inside Out 2 serves as an especially poignant reminder that all of our emotions and experiences, the good and bad, make us whole."
"It’s solid, middle-of-the-road Pixar, not quite as good as some of their better sequels but superior to the Cars follow-ups."
"The sequel pushes the control-room metaphor to its limits as Riley matures, depicting her as a quivering mess entirely ruled by whims."
Inside Out 2 is a harmless sequel that is fun for all ages but also absolutely unnecessary. The film recycles three-quarters of the original while introducing a quarter of new characters and ideas.
The plotting is very similar to the original and its setting loses some opportunities but the story’s insights into anxiety and the drawbacks to eternal happiness and sadness ring true for all ages in-between some solid laughs.
"Pixar signs its best sequel, not starring toys. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Inside Out 2 is overloaded but never dense, and is moving, tender and fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
For Gen Z and Alpha audiences (and their parents)—those navigating today’s “anxious generation” world with a hyperattuned (maybe overattuned) emotional vocabulary—Inside Out 2 is unsurprisingly resonant.
"The inner workings of a growing mind is captured in a fantastic fun way in Pixar‘s sequel that will charm children, adults, philosophers and psychologists alike"
"Ultimately, ""Inside Out 2"" is about Riley discovering herself and maybe even discovering that she might be more than just one thing. It's a really special movie and I definitely teared up!"
Inside Out 2 has become a very strong film that perfectly combines humor and heart and shows you what it is like to have to go through emotional chaos as a young person. [Full review in Spanish]
"Move over Bambi, there is a new weepy cartoon in town."
What matters is that the filmmakers made a good film following in the footsteps of a great one.
"Riley's expanded internal universe offers new places to discover. There may be less imaginative audacity, but the pace is maintained throughout the movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Its borderline-necessary messaging doesn't render it completely invulnerable, but should Pixar be up to it, they've earned an 'Inside Out 3'."
"While the four new emotions introduce fun and inventive layers to Riley's brain, the core structure of Inside Out 2 is nothing but a retread"
The storyline makes little sense and the main Emotion antagonist doesn't visually fit into parameters set by the already established characters.
"Banks on the original’s charm and concept to pull the viewer’s emotional heartstrings, albeit forcefully and without earned tenderness."
"This was a return to form for Pixar theatrical releases! The new emotions worked really well, particularly Maya Hawke as ""Anxiety"". I loved the quirky comedic moments and emotional depth. "
"It doesn't have the same emotional gut punch from the original, but I really enjoyed how they illustrated the different emotions and told a different story that was worthy of continuing with these characters. "
"Insightful and delightful, it's one of Pixar's best films in recent years. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The story retreads old themes, reminding us once again to avoid suppressing aspects of ourselves. But familiar messages somehow feel appropriate for a movie that transports viewers to that liminal state between childhood and adulthood."
"Another mid-tier Pixar sequel struggles to find its sense of self, coasting purely on cleverness. There are moments of joy, but it feels like a step down compared to the first film and Turning Red. "
"The imagery is smart, but it has the feeling of an educational children’s book. The movie‘s internal logic tests our own belief systems and fails to impart anything profoundly insightful to an adult audience."
"One of the rare sequels that not only matches the original, but may also surpass it. "
"It all adds up to an OK sequel that likely won't find itself on as many Ten Best lists as its ultra-memorable original did, with a tale that implies and even states: ""You feel less joy when you grow up."" Just don't readily believe it, kids."
"Way more fun than therapy! Anyone who’s experienced puberty, no matter how long ago, will appreciate it. We are reminded that just because we grow up doesn’t mean we’re not still dealing with Embarrassment, Ennui, Envy and especially Anxiety."
"Inside Out 2 is an all-around impressive directorial debut from Kelsey Mann...It more than lives up to the legacy of Inside Out, giving a much more nuanced and well-developed exploration of its genius concept."
"Coming from a studio that tends to match the eye rolls regarding news of a sequel with quality follow-ups, it’s an underwhelming result but still pleasant enough in spots and surely satisfying for those more closely aligned with Riley."
"Seeing Anxiety from this perspective is somewhat eye-opening for anyone who’s struggled with it and may be a good lead-in for parents to talk to their kids about the emotion, which can be confusing and potentially stifling at times."
"If there's any Pixar movie that deserves a sequel, it's Inside Out 2. All the new emotions have their place and they all have their moment."
This is summer’s “must see” movie; especially for parents and tweens and teens as it’ll spark a conversation and perhaps even help kids understand what’s happening at this very tumultuous time in their lives.
"It is a testament to human endurance and the profound impact of solidarity. Kabir Khan has crafted a compelling narrative that pays homage to Murlikant Petkar's legacy, leaving audiences inspired and moved by his indomitable spirit."
"This new work does not quite plumb the emotional depths of the first movie, but it is just as smart and entertaining."
"Anxiety might not be pleasant, but as Inside Out 2 will remind both teenagers and their parents, that doesn’t make it any less essential a part of growing up."
Inside Out 2 is a film whose genius lies in the fact that it embraces the idea that it is possible to transform ourselves without losing our essence. [Full review in Spanish]
Inside Out 2 misses that quest for excellence and instead goes for good enough.
"INSIDE OUT 2 is a great family film with beautiful animation and an emotional core that has made Pixar films stand out for decades. It’s not as good as the original, but this does course correct from some stumbles in the past."
"Inside Out 2 is a worthy sequel in its amusing and touching story of emotions that often conflict with each other inside a 13-year-old girl. The voice cast performances and visuals are stellar, even if the overall plot has no real surprises."
Inside Out 2 manages to recapture the charm of its predecessor while exploring more mature themes and profound emotions. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Sometimes you want a comfort watch, and Inside Out 2 is perfectly suited for that. Just don’t expect all those emotions to hit the same way they did the first time around."
"Surpasses the first film in every way. A therapy session for adults, while simultaneously presenting itself as a blueprint of the mind for young children. Such a fun hilarious adventure, and a return to form for Pixar. "
Pixar’s most emotionally powerful movie of the past 15 years.
"While it doesn’t surpass the wildly imaginative original the way Toy Story 2 did, it's still an outstanding successor. That is no small feat considering how high the bar was set."
Inside Out 2 merges the perspectives of kids and adults in the most amazing way.
"Inside Out may have been the best of all Pixar films, but what made it so owes to a premise that went beyond childhood innocence to imagine everyone’s psychology. Now, Inside Out 2 resorts to trite, “family movie” insipidness. "
"While Inside Out 2 wasn’t totally necessary, it makes a good case for feeling like a natural progression. This isn’t new territory, but it does further develop the first film’s central ideas in meaningful ways. "
"Inside Out 2 is a sequel that makes sense. Puberty brings with it a whole new set of emotions, so this follow-up is able to stay true to the spirit of the original while also moving naturally in a fresh direction. "
"Although there are some fun expansions to the established world, the film essentially colours within the lines, taking few risks and sticking to a tried-and-tested formula. It’s a timid offering from a once-bold studio..."
"It’ll probably do a billion dollars because it is so perfectly, nebulously, inoffensively “just okay.” And yet, there’s something neat about telling young people that emotions of all kinds are valuable."
"In further developing a daring conceit, the filmmakers create ever more opportunities for the whole thing to collapse on itself. They mostly keep things upright, but metaphors are strained near to the breaking point in the process."
"As in the first movie, the goal is to strive for balance, embrace complexity and learn to be OK with imperfection. I’m trying to do that myself with Inside Out 2, which, despite its many pleasures, is a pretty imperfect movie. "
“Inside Out 2” still sparkles from its lovable characters and relatable storylines told through emotions we all have. Providing a family-friendly avenue to discuss our feelings and mental health with loved ones.
Inside Out 2 is so beautifully realized that one almost can’t believe that someone actually got an animated sequel right.
"The film is set almost entirely in a three-day ice hockey camp for girls. Ice hockey! To non-American viewers, this is about as exciting and significant as competitive calligraphy. "
This toon may get stuck in your head -- in a good way. A great one to treat the grandkids to.
"As in Pixar’s house animation style of fuzzy, phosphorescent, and physically coherent surfaces, this summation is a safely hedged bet, and suggests any route toward the varieties of experience that children actually remember will remain safely not taken."
"Just as you'd expect, it's sweet, funny, sad, and clever throughout. It's a great ride that can be enjoyed while giving something to discuss as well as maybe some grace in understanding and remembering what happens in the mind during big life changes."
"For those viewers who are currently awash in the tumult of adolescence (and those who remember it clearly), Inside Out 2 feels remarkably true."
A pointedly funny and observant parable of teen angst that has a lot to say about the state of youth today.
"The good news is that “Inside Out 2” is a wonderfully entertaining picture with a story that justifies its existence and lays the groundwork for another installment, maybe even more. "
" While Inside Out 2 may not quite reach the heights of its predecessor, this is a Pixar delight that is artful in both its concept and execution. So see it, but remember to keep your emotions in check."
"Rarely does a sequel hit as hard as the original, but Pixar’s Inside Out 2 is a beautiful gift that reminds us of how vital all our feelings are."
"Inside Out 2 has a very similar scenario to the first film but it's done well. It's a solid sequel than then, in the final act, delivers that Pixar magic in a film that is very directly about battling anxiety."
"A successful update that takes the concept in creative and rewarding directions. Also, its colorful universe looks fantastic, especially in IMAX. "
I will never not appreciate the way these characters give us a fun visual language that makes it easy to talk through emotions with our kids. But the sequel doesn’t land the emotional wallop and the catharsis that the first movie did. 
Underneath Joy's primary mission is that secondary fear of the unknown that lies ahead. And the genius of this and other Pixar movies is that it faces this fear and comes out the other side. 
"The straightforward beauty and eloquence of the first film isn’t present in Inside Out 2, but that doesn’t mean it’s anything other than brilliant."
"It’s growing up like its human protagonist. Thanks to Anxiety—the best new addition—Inside Out 2 leaves its old sense of self behind. But it’s an expansion, not an evolution. It knows it cannot top its predecessor."
"If you like puns and you don’t mind therapy-talk, you’ll likely find much to love with Inside Out 2. ... But it does feel empty in a way the first simply wasn’t."
"Why is the sequel never the equal? Mostly because the surprise goes poof, along with the kick of originality. This followup to the animated Oscar-winning 2015 original can't do much about that, except deliver charm in sweet abundance. So why resist?"
"The sequel to Inside Out is terrific, smartly navigating the rough terrain that is puberty to showcase its beloved foundational emotions while introducing a new roster of well-developed characters."
"A perfectly okay movie, but it just never quite hits the mark as the first film."
"The latest Pixar sequel will turn you ""Inside Out"" with feelings."
Inside Out 2 adds more emotions into the mix as Riley becomes a teenager while not straying too far from the magic of its predecessor.
"Inside Out 2 runs the gamut of emotions, creating an epic odyssey about growing up and the turbulent emotions young teens exhibit during that process. As far as sequels go, it’s among Pixar’s best work."
"Inside Out 2 grows with Riley, and by doing so, it shows its audience a spiritual mirror that reflects their own self-image. It’s worth peering into. It’s even more difficult to forget."
"Inside Out 2 is a winner because it’s thought provoking in addressing how the coming of age passage can be difficult, awkward and beautiful all at once! "
"The first film took most of the chances and was justifiably rewarded. The sequel finds new avenues to explore but in a more crowd-pleasing, less challenging vein."
"While the second instalment doesn’t quite pack as much of an emotional punch, it’s still an incredibly creative, wonderfully animated & thought-provoking journey."
"Whip smart and sharply funny, “Inside Out 2” probably works best for older kids and adults, so find a kid you can take with you as an excuse."
"Two words ... Magnificent & Masterpiece. It's hard to say it's superior to the original, but it's certainly a significant evolution. with stunning animation, action, laughs & characters that exhibit and project integrity to the very last frame. Pixar!"
"True, the plot is basically a redo of the first film... but the writing’s sharp, the animation is delightful and, unusually for a modern-day family film, at a tight 95 minutes it doesn’t outstay its welcome."
There’s a comfort in knowing that we’re all a little crazy. That’s what makes this movie so special.
"Inside Out 2 is Pixar at its finest! A much-needed entertaining family comedy that's intelligent, funny & heartwarming. Not only is it up to par with the 2015 original, it's also one of Pixar's best sequels ever. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It feels like it has gone through too many cooks and the ingredients are less appetising, getting very complicated and yet strangely slow."
"I got enough laughs out of the new emotions to essentially enjoy Inside Out 2. But although it’s often charming and relatable, it’s a letdown when you consider the heights such a project could reach."
"A wonderfully clever sequel that ages up the concept with one dreaded word: Puberty. Whatever one’s age, there’s much to like in a movie that offers the requisite laughs and sweetness, while managing to feel quite profound."
But there is something that elevates this film above the most recent entries of mass entertainment: concision. [Full review in Spanish]
"Sweet, safe and satisfying, this Pixar sequel should reverse studio's downward trend."
"Inside Out 2 is a Pixar triumph that, arguably, even overshadows the first film, precisely because it deals with a period of life that is rife with confusion and uncertainty."
"This is probably its best film since Coco, and best sequel since Toy Story 3."
"If there’s a familiarity to this overall arc that keeps this sequel from being the imaginative revelation the first Inside Out was, it’s also true that this tale isn’t usually told with so many vivid and funny details."
"While a perfectly pleasant experience at the movies, Inside Out 2 doesn’t feel as complex or sophisticated as its predecessor. It's clever and there are laughs, but we recommend you temper your expectations if you hold the first one in high regard."
"...some of the greatest pathos in a Pixar production, right up there with WALL-E and TOY STORY 3."
"One of the best sequels Pixar has done. Anxiety and the other new emotions bring a whole new level of complexity to Riley that hits you in the heart. The original may still reign king, but Inside Out 2 is not far behind as it unlocks a new core memory."
"This second helping  — delivered under the direction of Kelsey Mann — keeps faith with the spirit of the 2015 original while offering fresh perspectives, a welcome change for a sequel."
"For every clever idea, there are several that are relatively clumsy. An eager voice cast—all of whom personify their emotions or characters with ease—cannot quite smooth over a vague mix of action and subtext."
"Following a massively impactful and beloved film like Inside Out is an intimidating task, but Anxiety and the group of new emotions...add new layers and laughs to the sequel that give it a fresh feel. "
"If the movie overall lacks the enchantment—and the depth—of its predecessor, and can come across as desperate at times, there are plenty of engaging moments along the way. "
"Inside Out 2 is more metaphor than meaning. It explains plenty about the confusing emotions associated with puberty, often in intelligent ways, but it rarely lets them be felt or experienced, the way its predecessor did. "
"Though it will probably assist most younger viewers if they have already seen the first movie, there can be no denying Pixar has crafted a refreshingly original work that will warmly resonate with all ages."
"A perfectly enjoyable, reliably entertaining, if safer and less awe-inspiring second installment in what could be a long-running franchise if Pixar so wanted. "
"More poignant than an out-and-out tearjerker, the observations of Inside Out 2 may still get adults a little misty."
"There's so much for them to have fun with in here in terms of just how people operate. That's what I felt about the previous movie, and I felt they really captured the magic of that in this sequel."
"Like Wish before it, Inside Out 2 plays just fine in the moment. "
"""Inside Out 2"" stays on beat. Things happen just when you think they will or want them to, and in some cases, you get the joke right before the character makes it."
"The film is wise enough to keep going with what the original film did so well.

"Welcome back, Pixar. Inside Out 2 is relatable to most ages and adds more maturity and empathy to the messiness that life can be. I felt seen."
"Inside Out 2 is not one of Pixar’s best all-time sequels, nor does it surpass the original, but the film is entertaining, emotional, and memorable all the same. It’s Pixar doing what Pixar does best."
Doubtless Inside Out 2 plays well for adults and kids alike. It just does not quite touch the genius of its predecessor.
"Like the best of Pixar, Inside Out 2 is doubled edged. It’s an adventure story for kids, but one that transcends the form with abstract, adult thoughts on the things that make us, us."
"Inside Out 2 attempts to tell a tale about the messiness of puberty but ends up being extremely messy itself, with none of the realism and subtlety that made the first film so celebrated."
"Inside Out 2 is a brilliantly animated sequel that delivers a rollercoaster of emotions with great voice acting. The film tackles important messages about authenticity and anxiety, though it will undoubtedly attract the ire of Disney and DEI haters."
"Hilarious, heartwarming, and hugely entertaining, 'Inside Out 2' does everything a great sequel should."
"A direct sequel that gets to skip a lot of the complicated explanations and ""here's how this works"" tutorials in favor of putting audiences through a 96-minute therapy session."
"A delightful, heartfelt and captivating experience for the whole family. "
"This is a Pixar sequel in the good mode of Toy Story, as opposed to the shakier territory of Monsters University and Finding Dory. The story is well thought-out, the animation is attractive, and the voice performances are wonderfully entertaining."
"Skillfully expands on its predecessor, introducing new emotions and navigating teen complexities. While not as groundbreaking, it delivers humor, heart, and a valuable message on emotional balance."
